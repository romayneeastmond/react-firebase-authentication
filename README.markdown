# React Forms with Firebase Authentication and Firestore Storage Demonstration

A React project that uses Firebase for authentication and an accompanying Firestore database to store user registration details.

## How to Use

Edit the **.env** file to include the project settings from a Firestore application. Also change the verification and login urls, if necessary. Back inside the authentication section, enable the Email/Password provider. Add any necessary authorized domains that will need access to authentication.

Inside the Firestore database settings add a rule that allows authenticated users to make collection changes.

Run an npm install or update

```
npm i
```

Starting the project will run it on the default React location http://localhost:3000

```
npm start
```
